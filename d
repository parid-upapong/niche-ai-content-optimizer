# Deep SEO & Semantic Mapping: Beyond Keywords
**Signature:** doc-01 | Documenter

EchoNiche doesn't just "stuff" keywords. It builds **Topical Authority**. Use this guide to understand how our SEO Analyst Agent works.

## 1. Keyword vs. Intent
Standard tools look for "Search Volume." EchoNiche looks for **"Intent Gaps."** 
- **Informational Intent:** "What is Brand Synthesis?"
- **Transactional Intent:** "Best AI MarTech for SMEs."

## 2. The Semantic Map
When you enter a keyword, the system generates a **Cluster Map**. 
- **Core Topic:** Your main keyword.
- **LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing):** Related terms Google expects to see.
- **Information Gain:** Unique sub-topics that *your* competitors are missing.

## 3. Utilizing "Information Gain"
To rank #1, you must provide value that doesn't exist elsewhere. Our AI will suggest "Value Add" sections, such as:
- Proprietary Case Studies.
- Unique Thai market insights.
- Contrarian viewpoints to standard industry advice.

## 4. Technical SEO Guardrails
Every post generated is pre-optimized for:
- **Schema Markup:** Automatic JSON-LD generation.
- **Header Hierarchy:** Logical H1 -> H2 -> H3 flow for crawlability.
- **Internal Linking:** Suggestions for connecting to your existing Brand Profile assets.

## 1. Executive Summary
EchoNiche AI is a next-generation MarTech platform designed to bridge the gap between generic AI content generation and high-impact, brand-specific marketing. Unlike standard LLM wrappers, EchoNiche focuses on **Brand Voice Synthesis (BVS)** and **Niche Semantic SEO** to help SMEs and creators dominate specific market segments with content that feels human and ranks superiorly.

## 2. Target Audience
1.  **SME Business Owners:** Who need consistent marketing but lack a dedicated copywriter.
2.  **Content Creators/Affiliate Marketers:** Operating in high-competition niche markets.
3.  **Digital Agencies:** Looking to scale content production while maintaining client-specific brand tones.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Brand Voice Synthesis (BVS) Engine
*   **Voice Training:** Users upload past content (blogs, social posts, emails) or provide a URL to "teach" the AI the brand's tone, vocabulary, and rhythm.
*   **Tone Profiles:** Ability to switch between different personas (e.g., "The Helpful Expert" vs. "The Disruptive Innovator").
*   **Style Guide Enforcement:** Automatic detection and correction of "Off-brand" terminology.

### 3.2 Niche Semantic SEO & Intent Mapping
*   **Topical Authority Planner:** Maps out clusters of content needed to dominate a niche, not just individual keywords.
*   **LSI & Entity Optimization:** Real-time suggestions for semantic keywords that Google associates with expert-level content.
*   **Competitor Gap Analysis:** Identifies what competitors in the niche are missing in their content.

### 3.3 AI Content Studio
*   **Interactive Editor:** A long-form editor where AI assists in writing, expanding, or rephrasing based on the BVS.
*   **Multi-Format Generator:** Single-click transformation of a blog post into social media snippets (LinkedIn, X, Instagram).
*   **Direct Integration:** Export options to WordPress, Webflow, and Medium.

# Configuring Your "Brand DNA" (BVS Guide)
**Signature:** doc-01 | Documenter

The secret to EchoNiche's superior output is the **Brand Voice Profile**. This document explains how to configure the BVS engine for maximum accuracy.

## 1. Understanding Tone Attributes
We use a 5-dimensional scale to map your voice:
*   **Formality:** (Casual ↔ Professional)
*   **Energy:** (Calm ↔ Enthusiastic)
*   **Perspective:** (First-person "I/We" ↔ Third-person authoritative)
*   **Directness:** (Story-driven ↔ Bullet-point efficiency)
*   **Empathy:** (Data-driven ↔ Human-centric)

## 2. Building the Lexicon (The "Soul" of Language)
In the Brand Lab, you can define:
*   **Signature Phrases:** Words you use often (e.g., "Revolutionizing the way...", "Let's dive deep...").
*   **Niche Jargon:** Specialized Thai/English terms specific to your industry (e.g., MarTech jargon, legal terminology).
*   **Exclusion List:** Words the AI must *never* use (e.g., avoiding the word "Transformative" if it feels overused in your niche).

## 3. Training the Engine with Samples
Upload 3-5 examples of your best-performing past content. Our BVS engine will perform a **Feature Extraction** to automatically identify your unique cadence and sentence structure patterns.

## 4. Voice Consistency Score
As you edit in the dashboard, you will see a **Voice Alignment Score (0-100%)**. 
*   **90%+: Perfect.** The AI has successfully mimicked your Brand DNA.
*   **<70%: Calibration Required.** Check if your Lexicon is too restrictive or if the SEO goals are conflicting with your brand tone.

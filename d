**Project:** Project Echo-Niche
**Version:** 1.0.0

## 1. The EchoNiche Philosophy
Traditional AI content tools produce generic, "gray" text. EchoNiche is different. We focus on **Brand Voice Synthesis (BVS)**—the art of capturing your brand's unique soul—and **Semantic SEO**, which ensures you don't just rank for keywords, but you own the entire topical niche.

## 2. The Core Workflow
To get the most out of EchoNiche, follow the **"3-S Master Flow"**:
1.  **Synthesize (Brand Profile):** Define your Brand DNA, Lexicon, and Tone.
2.  **Strategize (SEO Architect):** Map out "Information Gain" opportunities in your niche.
3.  **Scale (Content Artisan):** Generate and refine content that sounds like you, not a robot.

## 3. Quick Start Checklist
